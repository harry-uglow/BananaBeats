\section{Group Organisation}

It was decided that Harry would be the leader of this group.\\

We first discussed the design and construction of the main \textit{emulate} function in a meeting on Friday afternoon. Together as a group, we coded the main structure of the emulator, which involved creating structs (in \texttt{structs.h}) to represent our registers and memory, as well as instructions. Instructions would be handled by functions in the \texttt{executeInstructions.c} file.\\

We decided to split up the implementations of these functions by assigning each person an instruction type to concentrate on over the weekend. Because there was an imbalance in the amount of work each person needed to do, those with less work helped those with more work to do to implement their functions. The instruction types were distributed as follows:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Harry - Single Data Transfer
\item Shayan - Branch
\item Maurice - Multiply
\item Joshua - Data Processing
\end{itemize}
After the weekend, we worked to implement the rest of the main functions of the emulator, including file input, decoding instructions and the pipeline.  Harry focused on the pipeline and handling instructions, while Shayan and Maurice worked on the file input.

\subsection{Communication}
It was agreed that we would all try hard to make all git commit messages as detailed and clear as possible. When not physically working together, Facebook Messenger is our main channel of communication. We use it to dicuss what we each need to do and any bugs and faults which need fixing.
